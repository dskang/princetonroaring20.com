### Bio

![Christina](/images/members/current/christina.jpg)

Born in the land of all things great, New York City, Christina has
spent much of her life in an all-girls school complete with
schoolskirt. For this reason she was all too happy to be in a co-ed a
cappella group at Princeton. She heard about the Roaring 20's sweet
sound as a junior in high school and has been hooked ever since. When
sheâ€™s not singing with R20, she rows boats, bakes and speaks in
foreign tongues to confuse people.
