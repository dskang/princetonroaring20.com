### Bio

![Christina](/images/members/current/christina.jpg)

Born in the land of gossip girl, Christina has spent much of her life
in an all girls school complete with schoolskirt. For this reason she
was all too happy to be in a co-ed a cappella group at Princeton. She
heard about Roaring 20s sweet sound as a junior in high school and has
been hooked ever since. When she's not singing with R20, she rows
boats on the crew team, bakes cookies and brownies and sings musical
theatre songs and opera arias. She also likes to speak in foreign
tongues (French, Italian, German and periodically Swedish) to confuse
people.
