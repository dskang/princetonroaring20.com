### Bio

![Anna](/images/members/current/anna.jpg)

Anna effectively began singing the moment she left the womb. Despite
varied attempts by numerous others to silence her, she's pretty much
been in a constant state of song her entire life. In high school, she
found herself interested in formal training, and before she knew it,
she was singing arias in all sorts of languages. Though she keeps the
opera to a minimum in Roaring 20, she occasionally pesters her
suitemates in Wilson College by indulging in some Paramore or
Pocahontas or Purcell, depending on her mood. She generally has no
idea what she intends to do after college, but in the meantime, you
just might catch her sighing in sweet reminiscence over her distant
home back in the bay.
