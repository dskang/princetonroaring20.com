### Bio

![Katherine](/images/members/current/katherine.jpg)

A cheese-stick and dog loving Philly girl, Katherine is a first year
student who could not feel more at home with her new family, the
Roaring 20. She is an alto who loves the classic movies such as
Zoolander, Dodgeball and Dumb and Dumber, and her favorite hang-out
spot is the local Costco. When she isnâ€™t singing she loves hiking,
reading, playing squash and tennis, and cheering on the Phillies. She
enjoys movie scores and fart jokes, and is currently a pre-med
student, if the Princeton science courses don't scare her out of
it. Katherine is known back home as the girl who sings more than she
talks and the one who sneezes three times in a row without fail. She
sits watching every Community episode on OnDemand for hours and The
Far Side, goldfish, and Pearl Jam never fail to make her smile.
