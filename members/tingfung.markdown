### Bio

![Ting-Fung](/images/members/current/tingfung.jpg)

For a history major, Ting-Fung has miserably bad memorization
skills. It took him three attempts and one cheat sheet to get the
lyrics of his solo piece right during his first-round audition, so he
still doesn't quite understand why was ever given a callback - he is,
however, absolutely convinced that R20 is the best thing that has
happened to him at Princeton. He spends his spare time consuming
excessive quantities of dragonwell tea, salivating over the
scandalously enticing photos of the New York Times' dining pages,
telling friends how much he abhors the dense writing of Martin
Heidegger, and poring over Reddit.com's ever-so-fascinating IAmA
section. He dreams of becoming either a professor, a foreign
correspondent, or a member of the Haus of Gaga.
