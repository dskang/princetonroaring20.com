### Bio

![Ting-Fung](/images/members/current/tingfung.jpg)

For a history major, Ting-Fung has miserably bad memorization
skills. It took him three attempts and one cheat sheet to get the
lyrics of his solo piece right during his first-round audition, so he
still doesnâ€™t quite understand why was ever given a callback - he is,
however, absolutely convinced that R20 is the best thing that has
happened to him at Princeton. He is known for consuming excessive
quantities of earl grey tea, insisting that sneakers are not an
acceptable part of performance wear, and repeatedly getting into
kitchen accidents at the International Food Co-op. He is absolute
obsessed with the Killers, and once went all the way from Geneva to
London to watch them perform. He dreams of becoming either a diplomat,
the host of Lonely Planet, or a food journalist for the New York
Times.
