### Bio

![Michael](/images/members/current/michael.jpg)

Michael was born and raised by bison on the great plains, or that's
what his Sex On Broadway bio would have you believe. In fact, he was
born and raised just North of the great city of Chicago, where he has
rooted for the hopeless Cubs for as long as he can remember. He
attended New Trier high school, upon which the movie "Mean Girls" is
based, where he participated in the classical choir. He is very
excited to continue his singing experience with the Princeton Roaring
Twenty after having spent the fall of freshman year without their
guidance and musical expertise.
