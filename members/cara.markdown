### Bio

![Cara](/images/members/current/cara.jpg)

Cara, whose street name is Chocolate Thunda, brings the flavor to
Roaring 20. She also brings the volume…to the entire campus. Although
she is literally a force of nature, her bark is definitely worse than
her bite. Cara is a real softie on the inside. When she’s not belting
it out in the alto section, she can be heard singing TSwift and
MCyrus, gabbing about her love of giraffes and Coogi sweaters, busting
out her signature “BUHHH” laugh, or making love to her Chipotle
burrito bowl.
