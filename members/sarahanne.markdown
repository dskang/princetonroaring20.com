### Bio

![Sarah Anne](/images/members/current/sarahanne.jpg)

Sarah Anne, though born and raised in the sleepy suburb of Potomac,
Maryland, tells people at Princeton that she is from DC because she
has come to realize that no one knows where Potomac actually is. She
auditioned for Roaring 20 in the fall of her freshman year and is so
deliriously happy to contribute her voice to such a talented and
amazing group of people. A self-proclaimed theater dork, Sarah Anne
pretty much does everything possible to get herself onstage. When
sheÂ¢s not singing, acting, dancing, or doing anything else
performance-related, Sarah Anne can usually be found taking candid
photos of her unsuspecting friends or laughing uncontrollably at
inappropriate moments. Her life aspirations include playing Velma
Kelley in the musical Chicago and learning the entire dance to Single
Ladies.
