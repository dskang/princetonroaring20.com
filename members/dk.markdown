### Bio

![DK](/images/members/current/dk.jpg)

Growing up in Orange County under the care of his awesome
grandparents, Daniel spent much of his childhood singing and making
strange noises with his mouth. He occasionally posts YouTube videos of
himself singing and playing guitar, despite the fact that he only
knows the most basic of chords. In an attempt to enhance his skills,
he once agreed to eat a spoonful of wasabi in exchange for a guitar
lesson from his sister. He has yet to receive that guitar lesson.
