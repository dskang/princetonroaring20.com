### Bio

![DJ](/images/members/current/dj.jpg)

DJ was born and raised on the remote island of Manhattan, where he has
two fantastic parents and one lovely pet sister. He loves hiking,
camping, backpacking, and getting lost. He wears flip-flops year
round, enjoys Ultimate Frisbee, and has been known to "bro out" on
occasion. His favorite time of year is summer, but his favorite
holiday is Thanksgiving. DJ is particularly passionate about American
Literature, Chinese food, and crappy horror movies. If he's not
singing, he's probably asleep.
