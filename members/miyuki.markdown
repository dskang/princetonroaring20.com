### Bio

![Miyuki](/images/members/current/miyuki.jpg)

Born into the social hierarchy of the land of East and West Egg,
Miyuki decided to keep living the reality of F. Scott Fitzgerald's
novels and came to Princeton. There, her incredibly puzzling and
intriguing name continued to haunt her. None the less, in between
answering questions about her origins and whether or not her father
could catch flies with chopsticks, she found time to continue her life
of incredible indecision by joining the university orchestra, the
Roaring 20, on-campus musical casts, and all the while wishing she had
time to join a dance company. After a hectic first semester that was a
result of transitioning from a high-school class of 36 to a Princeton
class of over 1,000, an incredibly high-strung personality, and this
life of indecision, Miyuki pledged to pursue a life of peace,
serenity, and mental health. Miyuki now meditates daily.
