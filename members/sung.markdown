### Bio

![Sung]({{ site.github.url }}/images/members/current/sung.jpg)

Just when he is about to fade into history, Sung makes a grand return! Originally from the class of 2011, the Seoul-born tenor spent three years away from Princeton serving in the Republic of Korea Air Force, where he conducted top-secret operations of which he will share the details for a small fee. Even in the military however, he could not control his endless yearning for some sweet R20-style blending that he even organized an a cappella group with other service members, with a repertoire dedicated to ‘N sync. After three years of service, he is so excited to finally return to the Orange Bubble and serve up that sweet sound once again. Before Princeton, Sung attended St. Paul’s School in Concord, NH, where he learned to love singing with his all-male a cappella group, the TestosterTones. Currently, he can be found in Edwards Hall and will be happy to offer you a little K-Pop concert upon your visit.
