### Bio

![Torin](/images/members/current/torin.jpg)

Torin Rudeen is a collection of Carbon, Oxygen, and Hydrogen atoms
suffering from the persistent delusion of free will. His favorite
activities include generating energy by ingesting other collections of
organic molecules, respiring, and singing in Roaring 20. He has lived
his whole life in Eugene, Oregon, a town known mainly for its hippies,
anarchists, and astonishing density of health-food stores. He has been
somewhat disappointed so far by the difficulty of finding organic
granola in Princeton. In the meantime, he enjoys Chinese literature,
ramen, and writing bios.
