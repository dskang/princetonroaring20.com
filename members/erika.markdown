### Bio

![Erika](/images/members/current/erika.jpg)

Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Erika is a hard to miss ball of arpeggiated
giggles and nearly glass-shattering high notes. Erika spent her childhood prancing
around in frilly, pink tutus and pointe shoes, dreaming of becoming a professional
ballerina one day. However, after spending two years in the vocal department of
New York City’s “Fame School,” she realized she was destined to become an opera
singer. When she is not busy distracting all of Princeton from their studies with
outbursts of Mozart and Previn, Erika spends her time searching for her (currently
barely-there) chest voice in the R20 room, looking for cats to pet (and kidnap?), and
bringing “yasswerkfierce-ness” into the world.
