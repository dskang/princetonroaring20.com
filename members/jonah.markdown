### Bio

![Jonah](/images/members/current/jonah.jpg)

Jonah was born in the heart of Appalachia. Although he loves his old
new home in the frigid wasteland of western Maine and his new new home
at Princeton, he still looks forward to the times when those country
roads take him back to West Virginia. His musical tastes range from
the traditional (classical and folk) to the retro (New Wave and funk)
to the modern (hip-hop, pop, etc.) to the odd (Nerdcore, cartoon
themes). Due to this love of all types of music, he was thrilled to
join both Roaring 20 and the Chapel Choir his freshman fall.
