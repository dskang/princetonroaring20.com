### Bio

![Caroline](/images/members/current/caroline.jpg)

Caroline, who also goes by Candy, Candy Corn, Carol, and Christmas Carol (seasonal), was born and raised in the rolling Southern hills of Leesburg, VA. Her idols include Sutton Foster, Ron Swanson, Beyonce, and Michaelangelo (The ninja turtle, not the sculptor. Who's even heard of the sculptor.) When she's not tapping to sweet jams with R20, she's probably in rehearsal for one show or another. Caroline spends 90% of her time in rehearsal. Apart from performing, Caroline likes late nights, mismatched socks, giraffes, bright scarves, dance floors, and fluffy towels. She admits to occasionally watching Todders & Tiaras when the mood strikes her, but let's keep that between us.
