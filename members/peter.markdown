### Bio

![Peter](/images/members/current/peter.jpg)

Peter never formally sang in high school but played clarinet in the
band for four years and fronted a rock band. He grew up listening and
singing along to Paul Simon and Marcus Hummon (who is his
uncle-by-marriage, and who wrote "Bless the Broken Road"). Eventually
Peter discovered that although he thought he was singing in the same
octave as all of the bands on the radio, he was actually singing an
octave lower. In fact, he has a ridiculously low voice (think earth
tremor inducing), which he is making good use of in the R20 bass
section. You definitely don't want to mess with him though, because in
addition to being able to drink a lot more milk than you can, Peter is
also a black belt in Kung Fu and has a large stack of broken boards to
prove it.
