### Bio

![Teddy](/images/members/current/teddy.jpg)

Theodore, more commonly known as Teddy, is a species of humanoid that
enjoys whistling, climbing trees, and running long distances with or
without shoes. You can recognize Teddy by his brown hair and eyes, and
5'10" stature. He has three wonderful siblings, two parents, four
dogs, two peacocks, and other assorted fowl. Originally discovered on
ten acres of old farmland in southeast Michigan, Teddy is now often
sighted just south of the town of Princeton in the state of New
Jersey. When not singing with The Roaring 20 you also may find this
not-so-elusive creature running, biking, playing guitar or trumpet,
camping, practicing atlatl, or running on the tow path.  After three years of singing with Roaring 20, Teddy is brawnier and bassier, and would like to thank R20 for a host of wonderful experiences.
